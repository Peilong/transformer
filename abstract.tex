Heterogeneous architectures face challenges on resource allocation to
cores and accelerators as well as transparent acceleration.  We
propose ``{\em Transformer}", a run-time reprogrammable, heterogeneous
architecture with cores and reconfigurable logics for supporting
coarse-grained acceleration of dynamic, unpredictable workloads
presented in mobile and cloud computing environments. The architecture
allows run-time instantiation of one or more acceleration functions in
an on-chip reconfigurable logic in response to the demands of
compute-intensive software libraries. We design a hardware controller
and software wrapper functions to profile workloads, reprogram the
logic and invoke the accelerators. Novel heuristics are derived to
schedule accelerator functions. We explore the system parameters, such as L1 and L2 cache sizes, accelerator local buffer sizes, and chip resource
allocation for cores and accelerators, etc. for optimal performance
and power efficiency. Our simulation results show
that {\em Transformer} brings significant improvement on both performance
(up to 14x for single-type workloads and up to 2.3x for dynamic
workloads) and energy efficiency (up to 6.9x) for a wide range of
workloads.
