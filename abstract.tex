Heterogeneous architectures face challenges regarding transparent acceleration 
as well as the allocation of resources to cores and accelerators.  The 
``{\em Transformer}", a run-time reprogrammable, heterogeneous
architecture consisting of cores and reconfigurable logic with support for
coarse-grained acceleration of the dynamic, unpredictable workloads
present in mobile and cloud computing environments, is proposed as a solution. 
The architecture allows for the run-time instantiation of one or more acceleration functions,
present in an on-chip reconfigurable logic, which responds to the demands of
compute-intensive software libraries. The hardware controller
and software wrapper functions are designed to profile workloads, reprogram the
internal logic, and invoke the appropriate acceleration functions. Novel heuristics are derived with respect
to the accelerator function scheduling. In order to optimize performance and power efficiency, the appropriate 
system parameters are explored, including the L1 and L2 cache sizes, the accelerator local buffer sizes, as well
 as the allocation of resources to the cores and accelerators.  The simulation results indicate
that the {\em Transformer} provides significant improvements in terms of performance, up to 14$\times$ for single-type workloads and 2.3$\times$ for dynamic workloads, as well as energy efficiency, up to 6.9$\times$ for various workloads.
